									<h2 class="major">Workshop Topics</h2>
									<p>With the advancement of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, the concept of cooperative driving has been attracting increasing attention from both academia and industry. Connected vehicles, either driven by human drivers or automated controllers, are able to coordinate with each other or infrastructures through V2X communications in certain traffic scenarios to improve the overall performance. Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), cooperative ramp merging, connected eco-driving at signalized intersections, automated coordination at non-signalized intersections, among other cooperative driving applications of connected vehicles, have the potential to benefit the transportation system in terms of safety, mobility, resilience, and/or environmental sustainability.</p>

									<p>However, the market penetration rate of connected vehicles is expected to evolve gradually. There will certainly be a transition period where only a portion of the vehicles traveling in the traffic environment are connected (and potentially automated), while others have no V2X capabilities – either automated vehicles equipped with on-board sensors or legacy vehicles driven by human drivers. How to perform cooperative driving maneuvers in mixed traffic environments to allow the coordinations among all these vehicle types remains an open research question. </p>

									<p>This workshop focuses on sharing the state-of-the-art design, modeling, algorithms, simulation, and field implementation of cooperative driving in mixed traffic, and identifies challenges as well as research needs, aiming to encourage cross-disciplinary cooperation. The specific topics of interest are listed below: </p>

									<p>•	Cooperative perception or situation awareness enabled by sensors on multi-vehicles or sensor fusion between vehicles and infrastructure </p>
									<p>•	Driving behaviour modelling and driver intention inference </p>
									<p>•	V2X-based cooperative motion planning and motion control </p>
									<p>•	Cooperative driving methodologies for modelling the interaction between human-driven vehicles and automated vehicles </p>
									<p>•	Application of advanced machine learning techniques to cooperative driving </p>
									<p>•	Cyber security of cooperative driving systems </p>
									<p>•	Communication standard (including messaging) to enable cooperative driving </p>
									<p>•	Interaction between vehicles and vulnerable road users </p>
									<p>•	Advanced simulation of cooperative driving applications in mixed traffic </p>
									<p>•	Field implementation of cooperative driving in mixed traffic </p>

										Autonomous Vehicles Safety Assessment Simulation (ASAS) Platform Based on SUMO and CARLA</strong><br><br>
										Simulation-based safety assessment is a critical step in testing and evaluation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). 
										To assess AVs’ safety performance accurately, we developed a simulation platform based on SUMO and CARLA. 
										CARLA provides realistic inputs to AVs’ sensors such as photorealistic images that resemble real-world renderings,
										while SUMO generates the background vehicles (BVs) interacting with the AVs. Different from existing SUMO-based simulation 
										models, we developed new stochastic human driving models, which can create naturalistic behavioral patterns of human drivers. 
										Comparing with most existing models, which are deterministic and mainly calibrated for normal driving conditions, 
										the new models can resemble safety-critical scenarios, which are critical for safety assessment of AVs.</p><br><br>

										Cooperative Anomalous Driving Behavior Detection and Management</strong><br><br>
										Traditional traffic law enforcement and control measures, such as police force efforts and insurance repercussions, are relatively effective at addressing 
										serious anomalous driving behavior, i.e., through fines, penalties and in worst cases, criminal charges. However, small scale anomalous driving behavior 
										who are engaged in Aggressive/Distracted/Reckless (ADR) driving is more difficult for the traditional enforcement infrastructure to detect, much less address. 
										Detection of such ADR driving behavior is important, otherwise, it may jeopardize the safety of other vehicles as well as the efficiency of the transportation 
										system. In this talk, I will introduce the cooperative anomalous driving behavior detection and management system. The system leverages vehicles’ onboard 
										resources to determine a measure of the effect that the ADR behavior has had on other vehicles and generates control instruction(s) to mitigate the negative 
										effect of abnormal drivers. A hierarchical edge computing architecture is designed to enable cooperative anomalous driving behavior detection and management 
										system at the city-scale and its benefit is shown through large scale simulations performed in AIMSUN.</p><br><br>

										Quantifying the Environmental Benefits of Capacity Enhancing Traffic Management Strategies using AIMSUN Simulation</strong><br><br>
										The future of transportation with connected and automated vehicles presents challenges and opportunities in traffic management. 
										In the near future, vehicles will be equipped with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) to allow them travel safely with 
										short headway at higher speeds, hence achieving higher capacity, alleviating congestion, and improving fuel economy. However, 
										similar issues such as bottlenecks caused by frequent merges from freeway entrances will diminish the freeway capacity and the 
										fuel economy benefit of connected and automated vehicles. Traffic management strategies such as freeway ramp metering and variable 
										speed advisory have been commonly used to enhance freeway capacity and reduce delay at bottlenecks near merging on-ramps. This 
										study explored the potential benefit of implementing ramp metering and variable speed advisory on freeways with varying market 
										penetrations of CACC vehicles using a case study of a 13-mile freeway corridor in Sacramento, California. Simulation analysis 
										of detailed vehicle trajectory data that precisely capture the stop-and-go waves associated with freeway merge bottlenecks has 
										demonstrated that ramp metering and variable speed advisory can improve fuel economy by as much as 20%, and the improvement is 
										especially significant at higher market penetrations of CACC.</p><br><br>

										Traffic Optimization for Signalized Corridors  (TOSCo) Development and Evaluation with VISSIM</strong><br><br>
										The Traffic Optimization for Signalized Corridors (TOSCo) system is a vehicle-to-infrastructure connected vehicle 
										application that uses level one autonomy to adjust a vehicle’s speed on the approach of a signalized intersection.  
										The system uses information from the infrastructure’s DSRC broadcasts to plan a speed trajectory that allows it to 
										either pass through the intersection without stopping or stop in a smooth, coordinated fashion to reduce the amount 
										of time stopped at the intersection.  This presentation will explain the simulation setup for developing and testing 
										the TOSCo vehicle algorithm as well as the simulations for evaluating TOSCo performance for a corridor.</p><br><br>

										LGSVL Simulator: A High Fidelity Simulator for Autonomous Driving</strong><br><br>
										Testing autonomous driving algorithms on real autonomous vehicles is extremely costly and many researchers 
										and developers in the field cannot afford a real car and the corresponding sensors. 
										Although several free and open-source autonomous driving stacks, such as Autoware and Apollo are available, 
										choices of open-source simulators to use with them are limited. In this paper, 
										we introduce the LGSVL Simulator which is a high fidelity simulator for autonomous driving. 
										The simulator engine provides end-to-end, full-stack simulation which is ready to be hooked up to Autoware and Apollo. 
										In addition, simulator tools are provided with the core simulation engine which allow users to easily customize sensors, 
										create new types of controllable objects, replace some modules in the core simulator, and create digital twins of particular environments.</p><br><br>

										Connected and Automated Vehicles: Major Shifts in Vehicle R&D Methods</strong><br><br>
										Rapid advancement in vehicle computing technology, connectivity, controls, and autonomous operation of advanced
										vehicles has increased the difficulty of testing and modeling systems that control vehicles and traffic. Much 
										of the challenge stems from the complexity of the new system-of-systems approach required to manage connected 
										and autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems as they interact with other 
										vehicles, surrounding environments, and larger traffic networks. This talk will discuss some of the simulation 
										and hardware-in-the-loop approaches ORNL and partners are using to develop and combine new and old methods to 
										conduct research across these areas.</p><br><br>

										Modeling and Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic using an Integrated SUMO-Unity Platform</strong><br><br>
										With the increasing penetration rate of autonomous vehicles, the research need related to mixed traffic is increasing. 
										To provide an easier way to test autonomous algorithms in a mixed traffic scenario, 
										we develop an integrated SUMO-Unity platform. The platform creates user-controlled 
										and NPC vehicles in Unity based on the traffic flow generated from SUMO.
										The traffic flow recreated in Unity can react to the user-controlled 
										vehicles based on the basic car-following model and lane-change model. 
										The user-controlled vehicles therefore can be put into a virtual transportation network by applying real-time traffic simulation.</p><br><br>

										Learning Adaptable Policy via Meta-Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Decision-making Tasks</strong><br><br>										
										Learning from demonstrations has gained popularity in learning policies directly from expert behaviors 
										for decision-making and control tasks. Some state-of-the-art methods include Imitation Learning (IL), 
										Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), Adversarial 
										Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL). It does not require a reward function that is hard to be manually 
										designed especially for complex tasks, but it generally needs abundant of demonstrations to gain the 
										ability of mimicking expert behaviors. Furthermore, the learned behavior usually works only in that 
										specific task environment and fails to generalize to new tasks with different distributions. In reality, 
										it is usually the case that we continuously enrich the data set by collecting new data from new tasks or 
										environments. For example, to learn an automated lane-change behavior, we may train our vehicle agent with 
										thousands or even millions of labeled driving demonstrations from different cities or countries, but these 
										demonstrations may not cover all the possible situations and we may still have new data obtained from other 
										cities or countries that are not originally included in our training data set. In this situation, it is labor 
										intensive and cost expensive to keep labeling all the newly acquired data and retrain the model from scratch again. 
										Therefore, it is essential to have a model that can make good use of the knowledge learned from existing tasks and 
										generalize quickly to new tasks with limited or even unlabeled data samples. Meta-learning is an approach to adapt 
										learned models to novel settings by exploiting the inherent35learning similarities across a distribution of tasks. 
										In this work, we combine Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Meta-learning to learn the model initialization 
										that can be quickly fine-tuned and adapted to new situations with limited data. We then apply the proposed method to 
										complex decision-making tasks in autonomous vehicles.</p><br><br>

										Anomaly Behavior Management: Reducing the Impact of Anomalous Drivers with Connected Vehicles</strong><br><br>
										Passenger vehicles operated by anomalous drivers, who are distracted on roads and perform errorable driving behaviors, 
										result in increased risk of collisions to themselves and their surrounding vehicles. Eliminating the impact of anomalous 
										drivers to the surrounding vehicles is very critical to improve driving safety. In this study, an anomaly management system 
										is developed with the help of connected vehicles to solve the problem. An errorable car-following model is applied to model 
										the dynamics of anomalous vehicles and to analyze their impacts to other vehicles. The system utilizes connected vehicles to 
										monitor the errorable behaviors of the anomaly drivers and estimates acceleration and lane changing advice for connected vehicles 
										to avoid dangerous behaviors. In addition, a hierarchical architecture is integrated with the proposed system to reduce the risk 
										of collision caused by anomaly vehicles in large-scale road networks. A microscopic traffic simulation is applied to evaluate the 
										benefits of the proposed system on reducing the risk of collisions and improving mobility for both connected vehicles and whole 
										networks. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of market penetration rates of connected vehicles and traffic demand levels will be 
										conducted to understand the reliability of the system at different development stages of connected vehicles and traffic congestion.</p><br><br>

										Modeling the Impacts of Future Mobility Technologies using the POLARIS SMART Mobility Workflow</strong><br><br>
										Recent advances in vehicle technologies, mobility services and transportation system management have the potential to fundamentally change 
										the way transportation is provided and used in the near future. Technologies such as connectivity, both between vehicles and with infrastructure,
										and automation have the ability to allow vehicles to travel more efficiently, safely and economically, and enable new forms of mobility to emerge. 
										However, recent studies have also shown that there is the potential for these new technologies to drastically alter the way individuals travel 
										leading to increases in congestions, energy use, emissions and so on, in some scenarios. Different vehicle and transportation technologies 
										interact in complex ways with the transportation system as a whole and with individual travel behavior. In order to understand these complex 
										interactions and evaluate the potential benefits of future mobility technologies, the SMART Mobility modeling workflow was recently developed.  
										This workflow seeks to evaluate new transportation technologies such as connectivity, automation, sharing, and electrification using multi-level 
										simulation analysis that captures interactions between technologies and travelers. The workflow is centered around the POLARIS agent-based 
										activity-travel demand simulation tool, and integrates through multiple other models at different levels of scale and resolution (i.e. individual 
										vehicle simulations, connected vehicle simulations in traffic microsimulation, long-term land use simulation) to gain insights about the influence
										of new mobility and vehicle technologies at the system level.</p><br><br> -->
