									<h2 class="major">Workshop Topics</h2>
									<p>With the advancement of vehicle automation and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, the concept of cooperative driving has been attracting increasing attention 
									from both academia and industry. Connected and automated vehicles are able to coordinate with each other 
									or infrastructures to benefit the transportation system in terms of safety, mobility, resilience, and/or environmental sustainability.</p>

									<p>However, the market penetration rate of such vehicles is expected to evolve gradually. There will certainly be a transition period where only a portion 
									of the vehicles traveling in the traffic environment are connected and/or automated, while others are still conventional vehicles.
									How to perform cooperative driving maneuvers in mixed traffic environments to allow the 
									coordinations among all these vehicle types remains an open research question. </p>

									<p>This workshop focuses on sharing the state-of-the-art design, modeling, algorithms, simulation, and field implementation of cooperative driving in mixed traffic, 
									and identifies challenges as well as research needs, aiming to encourage cross-disciplinary cooperation.</p>
